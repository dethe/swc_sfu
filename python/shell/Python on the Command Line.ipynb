      "There are times when you will want to test things out in the Notebook, but create a re-usable script on the command line once you have things working. Or you may start in a Notebook but realize you will need to read in data, or write out results. While entire notebooks can be saved as Python using `File -> Download As -> Python (.py)`, saving a script from a single cell requires you to copy and paste. For Windows and Linux users, once you have copied the script, open the file you want to save it as in a text editor, paste, and save. Mac users can do this, or use the command-line shortcut: `pbpaste > filename.py` where you replace \"filename\" with the actual name of the script you would like to save."
